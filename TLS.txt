1. OpenSSL Findings (Target: www.google.com)

Certificate Chain:
- Leaf: www.google.com (The website itself)
- Intermediate: GTS CA 1C3 (The authority validating Google)
- Root: GTS Root R1 (The trusted root in the OS store)

Cipher Suite Used: 
TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
(This indicates AES-256 encryption using GCM mode and SHA-384 for hashing).

TLS Version: 
TLSv1.3

2. Wireshark Handshake Components
1. Client Hello: The client sends supported cipher suites, random bytes, and supported TLS versions to the server.
2. Server Hello: The server selects the strongest shared cipher suite and replies.

3. How TLS Provides Security

Confidentiality (Privacy):
TLS provides confidentiality through Symmetric Encryption (like AES). 
While the handshake uses Asymmetric Encryption (RSA or ECC) to verify identity and exchange keys securely, the actual data transfer is encrypted using a shared Session Key. 
This ensures that even if a hacker captures the packets (like we did in Wireshark), they only see scrambled "Application Data."

Integrity (Trust):
TLS provides integrity through Hashing (HMAC or AEAD tags like GCM). 
Every packet sent includes a cryptographic hash or tag. 
If a hacker intercepts a packet and tries to change a single bit (e.g., changing "transfer $10" to "transfer $99"), the hash calculation will fail upon arrival. 
The receiving computer will know the data was tampered with and will drop the connection immediately.
